Melanoma Skin Cancer Detection using CNN
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based image classification system for detecting melanoma skin cancer. The model is trained on dermatoscopic images to distinguish between benign and malignant skin lesions.
Key Features
CNN Architecture: Utilizes a custom CNN model optimized for skin lesion classification13.
Iterative Training: The model undergoes multiple training iterations to improve accuracy and performance2.
Model Selection: Implements a strategy to select the best performing model from multiple training runs2.
Multi-Algorithm Approach: Explores different machine learning algorithms to compare and enhance classification results2.
Medical Integration: Incorporates relevant medical information based on model predictions to provide comprehensive analysis1.
Technical Details
Framework: TensorFlow and scikit-learn for model development and training6.
Data Format: Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files for easy visualization and code execution6.
Dataset: Utilizes a curated dataset of dermatoscopic images for training and validation3.
Preprocessing: Implements data augmentation and normalization techniques to enhance model generalization13.
Performance
The model achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between benign and malignant skin lesions, contributing to early and accurate melanoma detection12.
Future Work
Expand the dataset to include a wider variety of skin lesion types.
Implement advanced techniques like transfer learning to further improve model performance.
Develop a user-friendly interface for easy deployment in clinical settings.
This project aims to assist dermatologists in the early detection of melanoma, potentially improving patient outcomes through timely diagnosis and treatment.
